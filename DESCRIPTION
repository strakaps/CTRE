Description: Fits a Continuous Time Random Exceedance (CTRE) model to a 
    "bursty" time series with heavy-tailed inter-arrival times 
    between events. For a given threshold, the threshold crossing times are
    Mittag-Leffler distributed, and estimates of the Mittag-Leffler 
    distribution parameters are computed.
